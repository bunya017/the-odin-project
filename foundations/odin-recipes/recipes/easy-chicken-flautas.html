  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Rolled tacos; these are the best. I learned how to make them and my husband loved them.</p>
  <h2>Ingridients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> ¼ cup butter</li>
    <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ cup minced onion</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped black olives</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>

    <li>8 flour tortillas</li>
    <li>oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    <li>toothpicks</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; stir flour into butter until smooth. Add onion to flour-butter mixture; cook and stir until onion is softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix black olives, lemon juice, oil, paprika, black pepper, and salt into onion mixture; cook and stir until heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir chicken into mixture and remove skillet from heat and cover.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large, heavy saucepan or deep-fryer.</li>
    <li>Fill tortillas with chicken mixture. Roll tortilla around filling and secure with a toothpick.</li>
    <li>Fry the rolled tortillas, working in batches, in the hot oil until browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer fried tortillas to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon or tongs.</li>
  </ul>
